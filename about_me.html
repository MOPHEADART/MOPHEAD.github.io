                Hi! My name MOPHEAD, an anime artist located in the central Florida area. My style mostly consists of Y2k, cyberpunk and mild fantasy elements. Growing up, I remember watching toonami which has hardwired my brain to the aesthetics I strive to replicate in my art. My favorite manga is BERSERK and my favorite anime is FLCL.

                As my skills as an artist have improved, I have begun to attend conventions to show the world my art. I hope to accomplish my dream of writing a manga in the coming year and I hope one day people will look at my art in awe! And who knows, maybe Iâ€™ll become one of the greats! Only one way to find out though, to swing the bat.
